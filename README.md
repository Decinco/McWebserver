# McWebserver

## About the mod
This mod runs a simple HTTP server alongside the minecraft server in seperate threads.

### Warning
If used wrongly this mod can be a security risk for your server and all devices connected to the network that your server is in.

Do **only** put files into your webservers root directory that you want to be accessible to the internet. Those files are **public** to the entire world.

### Setup

1. Head over to modrinth and curseforge (once approved) for now available in this repository's [releases](https://github.com/J-onasJones/McWebserver/releases/latest) and download it into your mods folder.
2. Restart Your Minecraft Server and let the mod create the config file. The webserver will be offline by default.
3. In the config file, enable the webserver and adjust all settings if needed.
4. Restart your Minecraft server and You're good to go!
